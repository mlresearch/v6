title: Causal Inference
abstract: 'This paper reviews a theory of causal inference based on the Structural
  Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a). The theory unifies the graphical,
  potential-outcome (Neyman-Rubin), decision analytical, and structural equation approaches
  to causation, and provides both a mathematical foundation and a friendly calculus
  for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper establishes
  a methodology for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) the answers
  to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effect of potential interventions,
  (2) queries about counterfactuals, and (3) queries about the direct (or indirect)
  effect of one event on another.'
