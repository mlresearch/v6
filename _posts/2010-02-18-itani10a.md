title: Structure Learning in Causal Cyclic Networks
abstract: Cyclic graphical models are unnecessary for accurate representation of joint
  probability distributions, but are often indispensable when a causal representation
  of variable relationships is desired. For variables with a cyclic causal dependence
  structure, DAGs are guaranteed not to recover the correct causal structure, and
  therefore may yield false predictions about the outcomes of perturbations (and even
  inference.) In this paper, we introduce an approach to generalize Bayesian Network
  structure learning to structures with cyclic dependence. We introduce a structure
  learning algorithm, prove its performance given reasonable assumptions, and use
  simulated data to compare its results to the results of standard Bayesian network
  structure learning. We then propose a modified, heuristic algorithm with more modest
  data requirements, and test its performance on a real-life dataset from molecular
  biology, containing causal, cyclic dependencies.
