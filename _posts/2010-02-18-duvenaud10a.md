title: Causal learning without DAGs
abstract: Causal learning methods are often evaluated in terms of their ability to
  discover a true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. However, in general
  the true structure is unknown and may not be a DAG structure.  We therefore consider
  evaluating causal learning methods in terms of predicting the effects of interventions
  on unseen test data.  Given this task, we show that there exist a variety of approaches
  to modeling causality, generalizing DAG-based methods.  Our experiments on synthetic
  and biological data indicate that some non-DAG models perform as well or better
  than DAG-based methods at causal prediction tasks.
