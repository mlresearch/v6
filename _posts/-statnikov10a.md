title: 'TIED: An Artificially Simulated Dataset with Multiple Markov Boundaries'
abstract: We present an artificially simulated dataset (TIED) constructed so that
  there are many minimal sets of variables with maximal predictivity (i.e., Markov
  boundaries) and likewise many sets of variables that are statistically indistinguishable
  from the set of direct causes and direct effects of the response variable. This
  dataset was used in the Potluck Causality Challenge to determine all statistically
  indistinguishable sets of direct causes and direct effects and all Markov boundaries
  of the response variable and also to predict the response variable in the independent
  test data. We also present baseline results of application of several algorithms
  to this dataset.
