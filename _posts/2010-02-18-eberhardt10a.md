title: Causal Discovery as a Game
abstract: This paper presents a game theoretic approach to causal discovery. The problem
  of causal discovery is framed as a game of the Scientist against Nature, in which
  Nature attempts to hide its secrets for as long as possible, and the Scientist makes
  her best effort at discovery while minimizing cost. This approach provides a very
  general framework for the assessment of different search procedures and a principled
  way of modeling the effect of choices between different experiments.
