title: 'Causality: Objectives and Assessment'
abstract: The NIPS 2008 workshop on causality provided a forum for researchers from
  different horizons to share their view on causal modeling and address the difficult
  question of assessing causal models. There has been a vivid debate on properly separating
  the notion of causality from particular models such as graphical models, which have
  been dominating the field in the past few years. Part of the workshop was dedicated
  to discussing the results of a challenge, which offered a wide variety of applications
  of causal modeling. We have regrouped in these proceedings the best papers presented.
  Most lectures were videotaped or recorded. All information regarding the challenge
  and the lectures are found at  http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/NIPS2008/.
  This introduction provides a synthesis of the findings and a gentle introduction
  to causality topics, which are the object of active research.
