title: Sparse Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series
abstract: Our goal is to estimate causal interactions in multivariate time series.
  Using vector autoregressive (VAR) models, these can be defined based on non-vanishing
  coefficients belonging to respective time-lagged instances. As in most cases a parsimonious
  causality structure is assumed, a promising approach to causal discovery consists
  in fitting VAR models with an additional sparsity-promoting regularization. Along
  this line we here propose that sparsity should be enforced for the subgroups of
  coefficients that belong to each pair of time series, as the absence of a causal
  relation requires the coefficients for all time-lags to become jointly zero. Such
  behavior can be achieved by means of \emphl_1,2-norm regularized regression, for
  which an efficient active set solver has been proposed recently. Our method is shown
  to outperform standard methods in recovering simulated causality graphs. The results
  are on par with a second novel approach which uses multiple statistical testing.
