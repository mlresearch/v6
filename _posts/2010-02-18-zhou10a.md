title: Discover Local Causal Network around a Target to a Given Depth
abstract: For a given target node \emph{T} and a given depth \emph{k â‰¥ 1}, we propose
  an algorithm for discovering a local causal network around the target \emph{T} to
  depth \emph{k}. In our algorithm, we find parents, children and some descendants
  (PCD) of nodes stepwise away from the target \emph{T} until all edges within the
  depth \emph{k} local network cannot be oriented further. Our algorithm extends the
  PCD-by-PCD algorithm for prediction with intervention presented in Yin et al. (2008).
  Our algorithm can construct a local network to depth \emph{k}, has a more efficient
  stop rule and finds PCDs along some but not all paths starting from the target.
