title: Discover Local Causal Network around a Target to a Given Depth
abstract: For a given target node \emphT and a given depth \emphk â‰¥ 1, we propose
  an algorithm for discovering a local causal network around the target \emphT to
  depth \emphk. In our algorithm, we find parents, children and some descendants (PCD)
  of nodes stepwise away from the target \emphT until all edges within the depth \emphk
  local network cannot be oriented further. Our algorithm extends the PCD-by-PCD algorithm
  for prediction with intervention presented in Yin et al. (2008). Our algorithm can
  construct a local network to depth \emphk, has a more efficient stop rule and finds
  PCDs along some but not all paths starting from the target.
