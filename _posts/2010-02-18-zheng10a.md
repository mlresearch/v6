title: Reverse Engineering of Asynchronous Boolean Networks via Minimum Explanatory
  Set and Maximum Likelihood
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose an approach for reconstructing asynchronous Boolean
  networks from observed data. We find the causal relationships in Boolean networks
  using an asynchronous evolution approach. In our approach, we first find a minimum
  explanatory set for a node to reduce complexity of candidate Boolean functions,
  and then we choose a Boolean function for the node based on the maximum likelihood.
  This approach is stimulated by the task SIGNET of the causal challenge #2 pot-luck
  (Jenkins, 2009). Besides the data set SIGNET, we also applied our approach to two
  other datasets to evaluate our approach: one is generated by Professor Isabelle
  Guyon and the other generated ourselves from the signal transduction network of
  Abscisic acid in guard cell.'
