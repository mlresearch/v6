title: 'SIGNET:  Boolean Rule Determination for Abscisic Acid Signaling'
abstract: This paper describes the SIGNET dataset generated for the Causality Challenge.
  Cellular signaling pathways are most elusive types of networks to access experimentally
  due to the lack of methods for determining the state of a signaling network in an
  intact living cell. Boolean network models are currently being used for the modeling
  of signaling networks due to their compact formulation and ability to adequately
  represent network dynamics without the need for chemical kinetics. The problem posed
  in the SIGNET challenge is to determine the set of Boolean rules that describe the
  interactions of nodes within a plant signaling network, given a set of 300 Boolean
  pseudodynamic simulations of the true rules. The two solution methods that were
  presented revealed that the problem can be solved to greater than 99% accuracy.
