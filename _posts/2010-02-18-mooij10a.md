title: Distinguishing between cause and effect
abstract: 'We describe eight data sets that together formed the CauseEffectPairs
  task in the Causality Challenge #2: Pot-Luck competition. Each set consists
  of a sample of a pair of statistically dependent random variables. One variable
  is known to cause the other one, but this information was hidden from the participants;
  the task was to identify which of the two variables was the cause and which one
  the effect, based upon the observed sample. The data sets were chosen such that
  we expect common agreement on the ground truth. Even though part of the statistical
  dependences may also be due to hidden common causes, common sense tells us that
  there is a significant cause-effect relation between the two variables in each pair.
  We also present baseline results using three different causal inference methods.'
