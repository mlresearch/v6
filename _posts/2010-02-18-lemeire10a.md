title: 'Inference of Graphical Causal Models: Representing the Meaningful Information
  of Probability Distributions'
abstract: This paper studies the feasibility and interpretation of learning the causal
  structure from observational data with the principles behind the Kolmogorov Minimal
  Sufficient Statistic (KMSS). The KMSS provides a generic solution to inductive inference.
  It states that we should seek for the minimal model that captures all regularities
  of the data. The conditional independencies following from the systemâ€™s causal structure
  are the regularities incorporated in a graphical causal model. The meaningful information
  provided by a Bayesian network corresponds to the decomposition of the description
  of the system into Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs). The decomposition
  is described by the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). For a causal interpretation of
  the DAG, the decomposition should imply modularity of the CPDs. The CPDs should
  match up with independent parts of reality that can be changed independently. We
  argue that if the shortest description of the joint distribution is given by separate
  descriptions of the conditional distributions for each variable given its effects,
  the decomposition given by the DAG should be considered as the top-ranked causal
  hypothesis. Even when the causal interpretation is faulty, it serves as a reference
  model. Modularity becomes, however, implausible if the concatenation of the description
  of some CPDs is compressible. Then there might be a kind of meta-mechanism governing
  some of the mechanisms or either a single mechanism responsible for setting the
  state of multiple variables.
