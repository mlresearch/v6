title: Learning Causal Models That Make Correct Manipulation Predictions With Time
  Series Data
abstract: One of the fundamental purposes of causal models is using them to predict
  the effects of manipulating various components of a system. It has been argued by
  Dash (2005, 2003) that the Do operator will fail when applied to an equilibrium
  model, unless the underlying dynamic system obeys what he calls Equilibration-Manipulation
  Commutability. Unfortunately, this fact renders most existing causal discovery algorithms
  unreliable for reasoning about manipulations. Motivated by this caveat, in this
  paper we present a novel approach to causal discovery of dynamic models from time
  series. The approach uses a representation of dynamic causal models motivated by
  Iwasaki and Simon (1994), which asserts that all “causation across time” occurs
  because a variable’s derivative has been affected instantaneously. We present an
  algorithm that exploits this representation within a constraint-based learning framework
  by numerically calculating derivatives and learning instantaneous relationships.
  We argue that due to numerical errors in higher order derivatives, care must be
  taken when learning causal structure, but we show that the Iwasaki-Simon representation
  reduces the search space considerably, allowing us to forego calculating many high-order
  derivatives. In order for our algorithm to discover the dynamic model, it is necessary
  that the time-scale of the data is much finer than any temporal process of the system.
  Finally, we show that our approach can correctly recover the structure of a fairly
  complex dynamic system, and can predict the effect of manipulations accurately when
  a manipulation does not cause an instability. To our knowledge, this is the first
  causal discovery algorithm that has demonstrated that it can correctly predict the
  effects of manipulations for a system that does not obey the EMC condition.
