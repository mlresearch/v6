title: Beware of the DAG!
abstract: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models are popular tools for describing causal
  relationships and for guiding attempts to learn them from data.  They appear to
  supply a means of extracting causal conclusions from probabilistic conditional independence
  properties inferred from purely observational data.  I take a critical look at  this
  enterprise, and suggest that it is in need of more, and more explicit, methodological
  and philosophical justification than it typically receives. In particular, I argue
  for the value of a clean separation between formal causal language and intuitive
  causal assumptions.
