title: Fast Committee-Based Structure Learning
abstract: Current methods for causal structure learning tend to be computationally
  intensive or intractable for large datasets. Some recent approaches have speeded
  up the process by first making hard decisions about the set of parents and children
  for each variable, in order to  break large-scale problems into sets of tractable
  local neighbourhoods. We use this principle in order to apply a structure learning
  committee for orientating edges between variables. We find that a combination of
  weak structure learners can be effective in recovering causal dependencies. Though
  such a formulation would be intractable for large problems at the global level,
  we show that it can run quickly when processing local neighbourhoods in turn. Experimental
  results show that this localized, committee-based approach has advantages over standard
  causal discovery algorithms both in terms of speed and accuracy.
