title: Bayesian Algorithms for Causal Data Mining
abstract: We present two Bayesian algorithms CD-B and CD-H for discovering unconfounded
  cause and effect relationships from observational data without assuming causal sufficiency
  which precludes hidden common causes for the observed variables. The CD-B algorithm
  first estimates the Markov blanket of a node \emphX using a Bayesian greedy search
  method and then applies Bayesian scoring methods to discriminate the parents and
  children of \emphX. Using the set of parents and set of children CD-B constructs
  a global Bayesian network and outputs the causal effects of a node \emphX based
  on the identification of Y arcs. Recall that if a node \emphX has two parent nodes
  \emphA, B and a child node \emphC such that there is no arc between \emphA, B and
  \emphA, B are not parents of \emphC, then the arc from \emphX to \emphC is called
  a Y arc. The CD-H algorithm uses the MMPC algorithm to estimate the union of parents
  and children of a target node \emphX. The subsequent steps are similar to those
  of CD-B. We evaluated the CD-B and CD-H algorithms empirically based on simulated
  data from four different Bayesian networks. We also present comparative results
  based on the identification of Y structures and Y arcs from the output of the PC,
  MMHC and FCI algorithms. The results appear promising for mining causal relationships
  that are unconfounded by hidden variables from observational data.
