title: Comparison of Granger Causality and Phase Slope Index
abstract: 'We recently proposed a new measure, termed Phase Slope Index (PSI), It
  estimates the causal direction of interactions robustly with respect to instantaneous
  mixtures of independent sources with arbitrary spectral content. We compared this
  method to Granger Causality for linear systems containing spatially and temporarily
  mixed noise and found that, in contrast to PSI, the latter was not able to properly
  distinguish truly interacting systems from mixed noise. Here, we extent this analysis
  with respect to two aspects: a) we analyze Granger causality and PSI also for non-mixed
  noise, and b) we analyze PSI for nonlinear interactions. We found a) that Granger
  causality, in contrast to PSI, fails also for non-mixed noise if the memory-time
  of the sender of information is long compared to the transmission time of the information,
  and b) that PSI, being a linear method, eventually misses nonlinear interactions
  but is unlikely to give false positive results.'
