title: Distinguishing Causes from Effects using Nonlinear Acyclic Causal Models
abstract: Distinguishing causes from effects is an important problem in many areas.  In
  this paper, we propose a very general but well defined nonlinear acyclic causal
  model, namely, post-nonlinear acyclic causal model with inner additive noise, to
  tackle this problem. In this model, each observed variable is generated by a nonlinear
  function of its parents,  with additive noise, followed by a nonlinear distortion.
  The nonlinearity in the second stage takes into account the effect of sensor distortions,
  which are usually encountered in practice. In the two-variable case, if all the
  nonlinearities involved in the model are invertible, by relating the proposed model
  to the post-nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) problem, we give the
  conditions under which the causal relation can be uniquely found. We present a two-step
  method, which is constrained nonlinear ICA followed by statistical independence
  tests, to distinguish the cause from the effect in the two-variable case. We apply
  this method to solve the problem ``CauseEffectPairs'' in the Pot-luck challenge,
  and successfully identify causes from effects.
