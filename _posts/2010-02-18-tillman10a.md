title: 'When causality matters for prediction: investigating the practical tradeoffs'
abstract: Recent evaluations have indicated that in practice, general methods for
  prediction which do not account for changes in the conditional distribution of a
  target variable given feature values in some cases outperform causal discovery based
  methods for prediction which \emphcan account for such changes. We investigate some
  possibilities which may explain these findings. We give theoretical conditions,
  which are confirmed experimentally, for when particular manipulations of variables
  should not affect predictions for a target. We then consider the tradeoff between
  errors related to causality, i.e. not accounting for changes in a distribution after
  variables are manipulated, and errors resulting from sample bias, overfitting, and
  assuming specific parametric forms that do not fit the data, which most existing
  causal discovery based methods are particularly prone to making.
