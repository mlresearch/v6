title: The Use of Bernoulli Mixture Models for Identifying Corners of a Hypercube
  and Extracting Boolean Rules From Data
abstract: This paper describes the use of Bernoulli mixture models for extracting
  boolean rules from data. Bernoulli mixtures identify high data density areas on
  the corners of a hypercube. One corner represents a conjunction of literals in a
  boolean clause and the set of all identified corners, of the hypercube, indicates
  disjuncts of clauses to form a rule. Further class labels can be used to select
  features or variables, in the individual conjuncts, that are relevant to the target
  variable. This method was applied to the SIGNET dataset of the causality workbench
  challenge. The dataset is derived from a biological signaling network with 21 time
  steps and 43 random boolean variables. Results indicate that Bernoulli mixtures
  are quite effective at extracting boolean rules from data.
